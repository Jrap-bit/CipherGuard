### Algorithms Description

## Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Hill Cipher
Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts blocks of plaintext letters. The algorithm uses matrix multiplication to encrypt and decrypt the message.

## Vernam Cipher
Vernam Cipher is a stream cipher that uses a key that is as long as the message. The key is combined with the plaintext using the XOR operation to produce the ciphertext.

## Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the plaintext is combined with a keyword. The keyword is repeated until it matches the length of the plaintext. The algorithm uses a Vigenere table to encrypt and decrypt the message.

## Playfair Cipher
Playfair Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of plaintext letters. The algorithm uses a 5x5 matrix containing a keyword to encrypt and decrypt the message.

## RSA
RSA is a public key cryptosystem that uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption.

## AES
AES is a symmetric block cipher that encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits. The algorithm uses a key that can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.

## DES
DES is a symmetric block cipher that encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 64 bits. The algorithm uses a key that is 56 bits long.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The algorithm allows two parties to agree on a shared secret without exchanging the secret key.

## ElGamal
ElGamal is a public key cryptosystem that uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption.

## Rail Fence Cipher
Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that encrypts plaintext by writing it in a zig-zag pattern on a set number of rows. The ciphertext is obtained by reading the letters off in a diagonal pattern.
